### Part 2 (75 pts)

In this case, I would first go and report this to the boss - after all, it was my job to find security issues such as this. If they were to take no action on it, and the issues were serious and could be found by an outsider, I would first go up the chain of command and see if someone along the line is willing to take action. If not, I would consider going to a consumer watchdog and raising the issue with them, while making sure that the vulnerability is not leaked to the general public. I think going fully public with it is a very extreme action, and should be the absolute last choice, and a very difficult one to make in practice. Either way, I would argue doing nothing or too little in this situation is unethical and puts lives in danger.

To me, acting ethically in this situation means finding a way to minimize harm to everyone involved - to the potential consumers, and also the comapny. Doing nothing puts consumers at risk, while going to the public with this issue at any point puts the company in a lot of risk, which could affect the livelyhood of employees.

One could argue that going directly to the public and forcing the company's hand is the best course of action, but as I said earlier, that could negatively affect the employees responsible for the vulnerabilities where it could have been fixed had I gone through proper channels first. One could also argue that not raising the issue at all could be the best course of action - if you don't raise attention to the vulnerability, it won't be found. Not only is this actively not doing the job you were assigned to do, but it can generally be assumed that attackers will try to find vulnerabilites at some point, so ignoring them won't make them go away.
